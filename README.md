📄 README: Shopee Checkout Assistant (AHK Script)
🛒 Overview
This AutoHotkey (AHK) script is designed to streamline the checkout process on Shopee, helping users reduce the delay between clicking buttons — particularly during high-demand flash sales or limited-stock drops.
Unlike full automation bots, this tool still requires human input, offering an interface to preconfigure actions for rapid execution when the user triggers them.
Please download and install AHK v1.1 from https://www.autohotkey.com/

⚙️ Features
✅ User-Friendly UI to configure:
Quantity of items to purchase
Screen coordinates for key checkout buttons (e.g., "Add to Cart", "Checkout", "Place Order")
Custom keybinds to trigger actions quickly
⚡ Fast execution to reduce the number of clicks and time needed at checkout
🖱️ Still requires human action to initiate the process

🧠 How It Works
Launch the script.
A window will prompt you to:
Enter how many units you want.
Click to record the screen position of relevant buttons.
Assign shortcut keys (e.g., F1 to checkout).
Press the hotkey when ready — the script will simulate fast, precise clicks based on your input.

🧭 Intended Use
This script is for personal, competitive use in scenarios where many buyers are racing to purchase the same item. It helps level the playing field for users competing against automated bots, without fully automating the process.

⚖️ Ethics & Responsibility
🧩 Is this morally acceptable?
This tool sits in a gray area:
✅ It requires active user participation, unlike full bots that auto-run.
✅ It doesn’t bypass any authentication, captcha, or system security.
❌ Still, it gives an edge over manual-only users, which may be against platform spirit or terms of service.

Please use this script responsibly.
I do not condone misuse, and you should check Shopee’s Terms of Service and local regulations before use.
